# Convert the following English description into code.

# Initialize n to be 1000. Initialize numbers to be a list of numbers from 2 to n, but not including n.
# With results starting as the empty list, repeat the following as long as numbers contains any numbers.
# Add the first number in numbers to the end of results.
# Remove every number in numbers that is evenly divisible by (has no remainder when divided by) the number that you had just added to results.
# How long is results?

# To test your code, when n is instead 100, the length of results is 25.
